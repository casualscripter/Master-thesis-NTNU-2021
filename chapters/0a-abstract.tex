\chapter*{Abstract}

For a less tech-savvy investigator, it is an advantage to be able to virtualise the suspects system. Being able to see it through the eyes of the suspect is easier than using complicated, integrated forensic tools.

If the solution is based on open source, even money can be saved.

In the theoretical part of this master thesis, only the necessary requirements were gathered. The deployment could also only be considered theoretically. Supplementary requirements were not discarded, but collected in the future work chapter.

In the practical part, a solution without an individual graphical user interface was developed. The uability is based on a context menu of the file manager. Since it is a complete bootable GNU/Linux system, the user does not have to install all the individual components, which should be too error-prone.

The comparison with proprietary solutions has shown that an individual graphical user interface is missing. It would simplify usability and guide the user better through the workflow.

However, the tests carried out that the final product is very flexible and has advantages with regard to operating systems that are not so widely used.
