Setting up an Arch Linux installation including searching for and adding further software and developing own scripts worked without any problems.

The decision to create and customise a complete operating system was the right approach from the author's point of view.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the development of an own graphical user interface as well as an automatism that makes the right decisions for the user had to be abandoned. This is also the biggest weak point of the rather unfinished product.

Writing the master thesis was the biggest challenge for the author and took more time than planned.

Writing a master thesis parallel to family and work is not advisable.

In principle, the author would not change anything about the development. However, he would also include in the requirements the development of an intelligent graphical user interface as well as the features from the Future work chapter that were not taken into account.

The author would choose a much more resources (personnel, time, finances, ...) and try to implement the project within the framework of his daily work.

Instead of a master thesis, he would write a manual, as this is a missing but necessary part of the later deployment.

Unfortunately, the author's job is not to develop software.

Even though the project will probably not be continued, the current status is more than enough for the work in the author's courses.

The project is a prototype, but far from a finished product.
