\chapter{Deployment}
\label{chap:deployment}

The development of Hellonium mainly took place during the Covid19 pandemic.

Since the Police Academy of Lower Saxony was not able to conduct any classroom training during the Covid19 pandemic, a personally accompanied introduction of the prototype within the framework of the seminars was unfortunately not possible.

An introduction without accompaniment by the author does not seem to make sense due to the lack of an individual, more intuitive user interface as well as a missing user manual.

From the author's point of view, further points from the chapter Future Work should be integrated before an introduction.

Before the nationwide deployment of an individually developed software, the product must always undergo an integration test in the test laboratory of the Central Police Directorate of the Lower Saxony Police.

In addition to the still outstanding professional tests, the part of the concept dealing with internal police public relations is still missing.

In summary, it requires considerably more resources (personnel, time, finances, ...) than a single person has available within the framework of his or her master's thesis.
